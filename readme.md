# NEAR-SDK-JS (Enclave)

## Local Installation
It is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Intel Mac. Other linux and M1 Macs should also work but they're not tested.

1. Make sure you have wget, make, cmake and nodejs. On Linux, also make sure you have gcc.
2. `./setup.sh`
3. `./build.sh`
4. Use near-cli to deploy `jsvm.wasm` to your choice of `<jsvm-account>` in a local neard.

## Usage

1. Write smart contracts with JavaScript. You can use most npm packages that uses portable ES2020 features. Export callable contract methods with export. See `examples/` for examples.
2. Build the contract with `path/to/near-sdk-js/builder.sh path/to/your/<contract-name>.js`.
3. If no errors happens, a `<contract-name>.base64` will be generate at current directory. 
4. Deploy the contract to an existing jsvm contract. You will need to attach some NEAR to cover the storage deposit. It's about 1 NEAR for every 100KB of contract. This deposit can be withdrawed when you remove the js contract. 
```
near call <jsvm-account> deploy_js_contract --accountId <your-account> --args $(cat <contract-name>.base64) --base64 --deposit 0.1
```
5. Encode the parameters and call. If the call cause the state increasement, you also need to attach NEAR to cover the storage deposit for the delta.
```
near call <jsvm-account> call_js_contract --accountId <caller-account> --args <encoded-args> --base64
```

Where `<encoded-args>` can be obtained by:
```
node encode_call.js js_contract_name method_name args
```

6. If you want to remove the js contract and withdraw the storage deposit, use:
```
near call <jsvm-account> remove_js_contract --accountId <your-account>
```

## Demo

### On a local node

1. Build the jsvm contract
```
./setup.sh
./build.sh
```

2. Go to nearcore, Build and start a local node
```
cargo build -p neard
target/debug/neard init

### On Testnet
Latest master version of near-sdk-js enclave has been deployed on `jsvm.testnet`. You can use it or deploy your own copy of jsvm, which is simiar to the steps for deploy on local node. The following is the step to deploy and call your contract on `jsvm.testnet`.

1. Build the contract
```
near-sdk-js (master) ./builder.sh examples/low-level/hello_near.js 
```

2. Create an account on testnet wallet. Login it with near-cli:
```
near-sdk-js (master) export NEAR_ENV=testnet
near-sdk-js (master) near login

Please authorize NEAR CLI on at least one of your accounts.

If your browser doesn't automatically open, please visit this URL
https://wallet.testnet.near.org/login/?referrer=NEAR+CLI&public_key=ed25519%3A6eNw1uLsVbvHJhPrcN9Rj9wefqfzxJ2tz7VqxY8m3F88&success_url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A5000
Please authorize at least one account at the URL above.

Which account did you authorize for use with NEAR CLI?
Enter it here (if not redirected automatically):
Logged in as [ jsvmtester.testnet ] with public key [ ed25519:6eNw1u... ] successfully
```

3. Deploy the JS contract:
```
near-sdk-js (master) export JSVM_ACCOUNT=jsvm.testnet
near-sdk-js (master) near call $JSVM_ACCOUNT deploy_js_contract --accountId jsvmtester.testnet --base64 --args $(cat hello_near.base64) --deposit 0.1
Scheduling a call: jsvm.testnet.deploy_js_contract(AgYsZXhhbXBsZXMvaGVsbG9fbmVhci5qcwpoZWxsbwxoZWxsbzIGZW52BmxvZxRIZWxsbyBOZWFyD7wDAAIAAL4DAAHAAwAADgAGAaABAAAAAQICCwC+AwABwAMBAQjqCMAA4cAB4ikpvAMBBAEACg4OQwYBvgMAAAADAAATADjhAAAAQuIAAAAE4wAAACQBACm8AwECA10OQwYBwAMAAAADAAEQADjhAAAAQuIAAAC/ACQBACm8AwUCA04HCDIyMjI=) with attached 0.1 NEAR

https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/46vC327SWs7JNV7G3XMHkRzETyc6WuxwkdwLhV6Go2kp
''
```
Note that, in order to deploy the contract, the deployer need to deposit sufficient amount of NEAR to cover storage deposit. It's roughly 0.01 NEAR for 1KB of contract. If you deposit more than required, the additional part will be refunded. If no adequate deposit is attached, the deploy will failed with a panic. If future deployment increase or decrease in size, the difference will need to be paid or refunded, respectively.

4. Call the JS contract:
```
near-sdk-js (master) near call $JSVM_ACCOUNT call_js_contract --accountId jsvmtester.testnet --args $(node encode_call.js jsvmtester.near hello '') --base64
Scheduling a call: jsvm.testnet.call_js_contract(anN2bXRlc3Rlci50ZXN0bmV0AGhlbGxvAA==)
Doing account.functionCall()

```

Note that, The second call shows this method can be call by anyone (`jsvmtester2.testnet` in above example, make sure you login the account with `near login`), not just the one who deployed this JS contract (`jsvmtester.testnet`).

## NEAR-SDK-JS Low Level API Reference

Use `env.func_name(args)` to call low level APIs in JavaScript contracts. `env` is already imported before contract start. For example, `env.read_register(0)`.
To use nightly host functions, such as `alt_bn128_g1_sum`, the enclave contract need to be built with `NEAR_NIGHTLY=1 ./build.sh` and deployed to a nearcore node that has nightly enabled.

### About Type 

- In arguments, `Uint64: Number | BigInt`. In return, `Uint64: BigInt`. Because JavaScript Number cannot hold all Uint64 without losing precision. But as arguments, interger number is also allowed for convinience. Same for `Uint128`.
- `String` in both arguments and return is a byte buffer encoded as a JavaScript String. Which means:
    - If the string have only 1 byte chars, the representation is same.
    - If the string have 2/3/4 byte char, it is break down to 2/3/4 bytes and each byte as a separate char.
    - Arbitrary binary data `0x00-0xff` is as the char '\x00-\xff'

It's intentional to represent string and bytes in this way because QuickJS doesn't have ArrayBuffer in C API.

- The signature may differs from Rust APIs. This is because JavaScript doesn't have pointers and not possible to pass pointer as arguments. So, Instead of `data_len: u64, data_ptr: u64`, JavaScript API pass the data directly: `data: String`.
- The lowest level Rust API cannot return value bigger than 64 bit integer. So some of the API pass pointer as Uint64 and the Rust function write return data at the location specified by pointer. In JavaScript we don't have this limitation and value is returned as API function return.


### About commented APIs
Some of the APIs below starts with `//`. This means this API is provided by nearcore, however they are intentionally removed for the JavaScript Enclave. The reason and alternative are documented in each API section.

### Registers API

```
function read_register(register_id: Uint64): String;
function register_len(register_id: Uint64): Uint64;
function write_register(register_id: Uint64, data: String);
```

### Context API

```
// function current_account_id(register_id: Uint64);
function signer_account_id(register_id: Uint64);
function signer_account_pk(register_id: Uint64);
function predecessor_account_id(register_id: Uint64);
// function input(register_id: Uint64);
function block_index(): Uint64;
function block_timestamp(): Uint64;
function epoch_height(): Uint64;
// function storage_usage(): Uint64;
```

The `current_account_id` would always puts the account id of the JavaScript VM contract account in given register. The naming `current_account_id` is therefore confusing and not as helpful as a Rust contract. In some case, developer may want to get JavaScript VM contract account name, for example, determines whether it's running on testnet or mainnet, and behaves differently. So we expose this functionality under `jsvm_account_id()`.

The `input` puts the argument passed to call the contract in given register. In JavaScript VM, this is encoded as `"js_contract_name\0method_name\0args...`. This format isn't very convinient to developer, therefore, separate API `jsvm_js_contract_name`, `jsvm_method_name` and `jsvm_args` are provided.

The `storage_usage` return the storage bytes used by JavaScript VM contract. User doesn't care about the storage usage of the JSVM. Instead, users care about storage usage of a given JavaScript contract. This can be obtained by `storage_read` and count the sum of `register_len`.

### Economics API
```
// function account_balance(): Uint128;
// function account_locked_balance(): Uint128;
function attached_deposit(): Uint128;
function prepaid_gas(): Uint64;
function used_gas(): Uint64;
```

The `account_balance` and `account_locked_balance` returns balance and locked_balance of JavaScript VM. Those are also not cared by users.

### Math API


```
function random_seed(register_id: Uint64);
function sha256(value: String, register_id: Uint64);
function keccak256(value: String, register_id: Uint64);
function keccak512(value: String, register_id: Uint64);
function ripemd160(value: String, register_id: Uint64);
function ecrecover(hash: String, sign: String, v: Uint64, malleability_flag: Uint64, register_id: Uint64): Uint64;
```

### Miscellaneous API


```
// function value_return(value: String);
function panic(msg?: String);
function panic_utf8(msg: String);
function log(msg: String);
function log_utf8(msg: String);
function log_utf16(msg: String);
// Name confliction with WASI. Can be re-exported with a different name on NEAR side with a protocol upgrade
// Or, this is actually not a primitive, can be implement with log and panic host functions in C side or JS side. 
// function abort(msg_ptr: Uint32, filename_ptr: Uint32, u32: Uint32, col: Uint32);
```

The `value_return` is a NEAR primitive that puts the value to return in a receipt. However we would want to access it as a JavaScript return value in a cross contract call. So we have a new API `jsvm_value_return`, which does return the value in receipt and also as a JavaScript value returned by `jsvm_call`. The `jsvm_value_return` should be used whenever you need `value_return`.

### Promises API

```
function promise_create(account_id: String, method_name: String, arguments: String, amount: Uint128, gas: Uint64): Uint64;
function promise_then(promise_index: Uint64, account_id: String, method_name: String, arguments: String, amount: Uint128, gas: Uint64): Uint64;
function promise_and(...promise_idx: Uint64): Uint64;
function promise_batch_create(account_id: String): Uint64;
function promise_batch_then(promise_index: Uint64, account_id: String): Uint64;
```

### Promise API actions

```
// function promise_batch_action_create_account(promise_index: Uint64); // not allow users to create *.jsvm account
// function promise_batch_action_deploy_contract(promise_index: Uint64, code: String); // batch actions are applied to create_account_action, but that is not allowed
// function promise_batch_action_function_call(promise_index: Uint64, method_name: String, arguments: String, amount: Uint128, gas: Uint64);
// function promise_batch_action_transfer(promise_index: Uint64, amount: Uint128);
// function promise_batch_action_stake(promise_index: Uint64, amount: Uint128, public_key: String);
// function promise_batch_action_add_key_with_full_access(promise_index: Uint64, public_key: String, nonce: Uint64);
// function promise_batch_action_add_key_with_function_call(promise_index: Uint64, public_key: String, nonce: Uint64, allowance: Uint128, receiver_id: String, method_names: String);
// function promise_batch_action_delete_key(promise_index: Uint64, public_key: String);
// function promise_batch_action_delete_account(promise_index: Uint64, beneficiary_id: String);
```

All Promise batch actions act on the JSVM contract, creating a subaccount of it and acting on it. JSVM would be a common VM used by the community instead of a Rust  contract owned by the deployer. Terefore, creating subaccounts and subsequent actions towards subaccounts are not allowed.

### Promise API results

```
function promise_results_count(void): Uint64;
function promise_result(result_idx: Uint64, register_id: Uint64): Uint64;
function promise_return(promise_idx: Uint64);
```

### Storage API

```
// function storage_write(key: String, value: String, register_id: Uint64): Uint64; // user can only access contract's storage
function storage_read(key: String, register_id: Uint64): Uint64;
// function storage_remove(key: String, register_id: Uint64): Uint64; // same as storage_write
function storage_has_key(key: String): Uint64;
```

The `storage_write` and `storage_remove` have access to all JavaScript contract codes and states deployed on JSVM. User can only write to their account owned code and state, as a substate of the JSVM. Therefor these two APIs are disallowed. Use `jsvm_storage_write` and `jsvm_storage_remove` instead. Read to other people owned code and state is allowed, as they're public as part of the blockchain anyway.

### Validator API

```
function validator_stake(account_id: String): Uint128;
function validator_total_stake(): Uint128;
```

### Alt BN128

```
function alt_bn128_g1_multiexp(value: String, register_id: Uint64);
function alt_bn128_g1_sum(value: String, register_id: Uint64);
function alt_bn128_pairing_check(value: String): Uint64;
```

## JSVM Specific APIs
Due to the design of JavaScript VM Contract, some additonal APIs are provided to obtain context, access storage and cross contract call. Since they're not documented at [NEAR nomicon](https://nomicon.io/). They're explained here.

### Obtain Context
```
function jsvm_account_id(register_id: Uint64);
function jsvm_js_contract_name(register_id: Uint64);
function jsvm_method_name(register_id: Uint64);
function jsvm_args(register_id: Uint64);
```

The `jsvm_account_id` put the JavaScript VM's contract account ID into given register.

The `jsvm_js_contract_name`, when called, put the JavaScript contract name that are called at the moment, into given register.

The `jsvm_method_name` put the method name being called into given register.

The `jsvm_args` return the arguments passed to the method, into given register.

### Storage Access
```
function jsvm_storage_write(key: String, value: String, register_id: Uint64): Uint64;
function jsvm_storage_read(key: String, register_id: Uint64): Uint64;
function jsvm_storage_remove(key: String, register_id: Uint64): Uint64;
function jsvm_storage_has_key(key: String): Uint64;
```

These are equivalent to `storage_*` but access limit to the substate of current JS contract. The `jsvm_storage_write` and `jsvm_storage_remove` require and refund deposit to cover the storage delta. `jsvm_storage_*` access the substate of current JS contract by prefix the key of current JS contract name (deployer's account id). You can use `storage_read` and `storage_has_key` to get code and state of other JS contracts. More specifically: code of `contractA` is stored under the key `contractA/code`. state of `contractA` is stored under `contractA/state/` concat with developer specifid key. And:
```
jsvm_storage_read(k, register_id) 
// equvalent to
storage_read(jsvm_js_contract_name + '/state/' + k)
```

### Cross Contract Call
```
function jsvm_value_return(value: String);
function jsvm_call(contract_name: String, method: String, args: String, register_id: Uint64);
```

The `jsvm_value_return` is the version of `value_return` that should be used in all JavaScript contracts. It play well with `jsvm_call`. 

The `jsvm_call` invoke a synchronous cross contract call, to the given JavaScript `contract_name`, `method` with `args`. And capture the value returned from the call and stored in `register_id`.

## Error Handling in NEAR-SDK-JS

### Error handling behavior

- when js throws an error, uncatched, then transaction fails with GuestPanic error, with the user js error message and stacktrace
- when call host function with inappropriate type, means incorrect number of arguments or arg is not expected type:
    - if arguments less than params, remaining argument are set as 'undefined'
    - if arguments more than params, remaining argument are ignored
    - if argument is different than the required type, it'll be coerced to required type
    - if argument is different than the required type but cannot be coerced, will throw runtime type error, also with message and stacktrace

### The error reporting capability of a wasm contract
Smart contract can only use `panic` or `panic_utf8` to abort from execution. That is of error kind `GuestPanic {msg}`. It displays in RPC as `"Smart contract panicked: {msg}"`
And only `panic_utf8` can set that message. 
Other than this, if calls a host function, it can returns error provided by that host function. For example, any host function can return a `GasExceeded`. `log_utf8` can return `BadUTF8`. This behavior is part of protocol and we cannot control or trigger in JavaScript (without calling `env.*`). 

### Use errors
You can throw an error in JavaScript. Our quickjs runtime will detect and automatically invoke `panic_utf8` with `"{error.message}\n:{error.stack}"`. As a result, transaction will fail with `"Smart contract panicked: {error.message}\n{error.stack}"` error message.

### Use verror
User can use verror this way:
1. catch an error, attach information to it
2. return/rethrow the error, attach more information to it
3. throw the final verror, `throw e`, same as in nodejs.

Under the hood, our quickjs runtime would take the final throwed error, and invoke panic_utf8("{error.message}\n{error.stack}")

## Debug and Test
To get more debug utilities, such as debug print (`debug.log`) and logging stacktrace, you can build JSVM with sandbox flag: `NEAR_SANDBOX=1 ./build.sh`. A `jsvm_sandbox.wasm` will be build in current directory. You can then deploy sandbox versioned jsvm to a local [near-sandbox](https://github.com/near/sandbox). near-sandbox can be launched either manually or via the official testing framework [near-workspaces](https://github.com/near/workspaces-js). We recommend to use near-workspaces to write tests for your smart contracts. An example of use near-workspaces in a JS contract project can be found in `examples/project/`. 

Note that, `jsvm.wasm` can be used for sandbox/near-workspaces as well. But to debug print, you need to use `jsvm_sandbox.wasm` instead.
